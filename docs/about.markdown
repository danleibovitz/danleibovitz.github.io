I am currently a Masters student in [Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.uzh.ch/index.php?id=biostat) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/de.html) and a biostatistician at [Ava AG](https://www.avawomen.com/). I am experienced in statistical modeling, data analysis, biomedical & health research, and project management. 

On the side, I'm currently dabbling in open source libraries for [mixture models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20a%20mixture%20model,which%20an%20individual%20observation%20belongs.). You can find the source code for public/open source projects, including this website, at my [github](https://github.com/danleibovitz).
