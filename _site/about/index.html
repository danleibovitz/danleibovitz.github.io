<p>I am currently a Masters student in <a href="https://www.biostat.uzh.ch/index.php?id=biostat">Biostatistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/de.html">University of Zurich</a> and a biostatistician at <a href="https://www.avawomen.com/">Ava AG</a>. I am experienced in statistical modeling, data analysis, biomedical &amp; health research, and project management.</p>

<p>On the side, Iâ€™m currently dabbling in open source libraries for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20a%20mixture%20model,which%20an%20individual%20observation%20belongs.">mixture models</a>. You can find the source code for public/open source projects, including this website, on my <a href="https://github.com/danleibovitz">github</a>.</p>
